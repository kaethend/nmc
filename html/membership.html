    <h1>membership in nmc</h1>
    <p>NMC members are volunteers who go through extensive training to become skilled counselors. Each member has breastfed her baby for at least six months, receives 21 hours of breastfeeding education, completes extensive reading requirements, attends an NMC breastfeeding community class, shadows on hospital rounds with a lactation consultant or participates in a home visit, counsels moms, and takes a comprehensive exam to fulfill the requirements of becoming a fully trained counselor. </p>
    <p>New members serve a provisional period for six to twelve months, under the guidance of an experienced member who serves as her advisor/mentor. New members are often women who received assistance from NMC counselors and want to provide support to other new moms so they, too, can have a successful and positive breastfeeding experience.</p>
